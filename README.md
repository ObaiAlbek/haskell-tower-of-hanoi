# 🏰 Tower of Hanoi – Haskell Implementation

This project contains a clean, recursive implementation of the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle in Haskell.  
It demonstrates fundamental concepts in functional programming:

- Recursion  
- Pattern matching  
- Pure functions  
- Mathematical problem solving  
- Optional: printing moves to the console  
- Optional: HUnit tests

## 🧩 Problem Description

The **Tower of Hanoi** is a mathematical puzzle consisting of:

- Three rods (A, B, C)
- A number of disks of different sizes
- The goal: move all disks from rod A to rod C  
- **Rules:**
  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time  
  2. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller one  
  3. Only the upper disk of a stack can be moved  

This implementation solves the puzzle using **pure recursion**.
